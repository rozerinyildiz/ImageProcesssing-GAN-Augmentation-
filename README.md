# ImageProcesssing-GAN-Augmentation-
Image processing and classification with GAN Augmentation

The skin is the largest organ of the body which provides protection, regulates the body fluids and temperature, and enables a sense of the external environment[1]. So skin diseases are one of the most common and significant types of health illnesses faced by people for ages. The identification of skin disease, in general, relies on the expertise of doctors and skin biopsy results. It has been observed that most of the cases remain unnoticed because of the lack of better medical infrastructure and facilities. This paper is devoted to solving this challenge. An automated computer-based system for identifying and classifying skin diseases through images is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and cope with the scarcity of experts. In this paper, image classification will be explained and image classification methods applied on the dataset consisting of skin diseases (eczema, rosacea, melanoma, keratosis-pilaris) will be explained and their accuracy will be compared. For this, image classification will be explained first, then the image processing methods used and their accuracy will be mentioned. Datasets of common diseases such as eczema, melanoma, keratosis pilaris, and rosacea were used in this project. In this project, Colaboratory, a product of Google Research, or "Colab" for short, and Python programming language were used.
